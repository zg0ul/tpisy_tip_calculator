# tipsy - A tip calculator

Tipsy is a simple Tip calculator app, you can change the tip percentage to one of the pre-set ones, or set a custom tip using the custom tip button, which allows easy modification and access to that custom value.

For state management, `Riverpod` is used.

All the outputs at the bottom change in real time as new bill, tip, and or split values are given.
